# employee-management-app

###### By Ashuit


This is an employee management back-end system, created using Java Spring Boot, that could be linked to a front-end to make API calls to an employee database.
It has various CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities to maintain the system and keep it updated.
It is split into two tables. A table for departments and a table for employees. 
This system is designed for companies to make it more convenient for them store, update and maintain employee data as well as department data.
